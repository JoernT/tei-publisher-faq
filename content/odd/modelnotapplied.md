## Why does my added model not have an effect?

You added another model rule to an elementSpec but it does not seem to have any effect. This might be due to the rules for selecting a model:

The processor walks through all models in sequence and stops at the first one which either has a matching `@predicate` and/or `@output` or neither of both. **Order is important!** Therefore you should always place models for specific cases first and the most general (without predicate or output) last. If your general model is placed in front of your more specific models, it will always match:

```xml
<elementSpec mode="change" ident="hi">
  <model behaviour="inline"/>
  <model predicate="@rend='bold'" behaviour="inline">
    <outputRendition>font-weight: bold;</outputRendition>
  </model>
</elementSpec>
```

Another common case is missing the step which generates transform code on the basis of your ODD. If you are using the graphic ODD editor this step is performed automatically upon saving the ODD. When editing manually make sure you click on regenerate button in the list of ODDs in the TEI Publisher or execute `modules/lib/regenerate.xql` script. The latter is the only method to regenerate transform code in your custom application without using the graphic ODD editor.

## How can I find out which model applied?

When looking at the HTML display of a document, you might wonder which `<elementSpec>` or `<model>` is generating a certain HTML output. TEI Publisher by default outputs HTML class names, which can help you to figure this out.

Let's assume we want to find out, which elementSpec/model is spitting out the stage instructions in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet: within the browser window, right click on the text to inspect. From the context menu, select *Inspect* (or the corresponding item in your system language). This should open the browser's developer tools, either within the same or a separate window and show the tab for inspecting elements. The details differ slightly between various browsers, but all of them offer similar base functionality.

The HTML source code of the element for which you clicked *Inspect* should be highlighted:

```
<div class="tei-stage2">Enter Sampson and Gregory, with Swords and Bucklers, 
of the House of Capulet.</div>
```

Look at the **class** attribute: "tei-stage2" is a class name generated by TEI Publisher and it tells us that this HTML element was output by the "stage" `<elementSpec>` using its second `<model>`. Indeed, if we open the Shakespeare ODD and check the `<elementSpec>` for "stage", we see 3 models, of which the 2nd generates a centered block.
