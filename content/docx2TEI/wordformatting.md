## Some of my Word formatting is not preserved upon import

When uploading a Word document to Publisher it is converted to TEI, using a custom ODD for the tranformation. Please note that the focus of this conversion is to preserve textual content, structure and basic semantics of the text, not provide authoritative mapping of complete set of MS Word features to TEI. Consider customizing the docx.odd if you need a mapping for a particular Word feature to TEI.
