***Tuttle*** adds version control to data collections in eXist-db applications such as TEI Publisher.

It is part of and published by the [e-editiones society](https://e-editiones.org/) and can be used alongside TEI Publisher to allow synchronization
of data collections between TEI Publisher instances and a Git repository. 

***Tuttle*** wraps the APIs of the Git service providers under a common OpenAPI in TEI Publisher allowing
projects to seemlessly add version control to their data.
