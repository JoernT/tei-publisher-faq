On a fresh install, TEI Publisher creates a user `tei` with a password `simple`. It also creates another user `tei-demo` with a password `demo`, who can upload documents into the *Playground* collection. You can change these passwords (and it is strongly recommended to do so, if your eXist instance runs on a server and would be accessible to other users).

When generating your own application, the generator form requires you to fill in a user and password for the new application. Likewise, this password can be later changed via eXist Usermanager.
