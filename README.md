# Contents of the TEI Publisher FAQ

This repository contains the contents for the Frequently Asked Questions site. We're moving this outside the TEI Publisher core application as we want to make contributions as easy as possible. 

Therefore the FAQ site is directly built from this repository, all content is written in markdown and we assume a basic directory structure to organize the articles.
