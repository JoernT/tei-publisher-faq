# Contents of the TEI Publisher FAQ

This repository contains the contents for the [Frequently Asked Questions](https://faq.teipublisher.com/) site. We're moving this outside the TEI Publisher core application as we want to make contributions as easy as possible. 

## Proposing new entries

If you'd like to propose an entry not having it all prepared yet, please consider creating a [ticket](https://github.com/eeditiones/tei-publisher-faq/issues) in the issue tracker. You can suggest a topic, solicit opinions and also subsequently collaborate and discuss the shape of the corresponding article in there.

## How to contribute to this FAQ

The website is directly generated from the markdown files stored in the `content` subdirectory of the [github repository](https://github.com/eeditiones/tei-publisher-faq/tree/master/content). All contributions are welcome.

### Quick edits via GitHub

You can make changes to any existing page by clicking on the **Edit this page** link at the top right of the page. All you need is a GitHub user account. Clicking the link will open the corresponding markdown file on github for editing and you can start applying your changes immediately.

To add new files, navigate to the correct subdirectory in the [github repository](https://github.com/eeditiones/tei-publisher-faq/tree/master/content) and press the **Add file** button on the top right above the directory listing.

Once you are done with editing, fill out the **Propose changes** form at the bottom of the page and click the green button. Changes will not go life immediately. Instead, you are asked to create a so called *pull request*, which will then be reviewed by a core team member. You do not need to fill out anything if you already provided a description of your changes, so just press the green **Create pull request** button.

To work on larger, new articles we recommend to write your text offline first in an editor of your choice. Most text editors (including oXygen) provide some support for writing markdown.
